# SEEDLAB_TEAM8
Mini-Project Deliverables
## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to store all working code that controls our robot for the Miniproject.
## Organization
Our repository will have one folder with all final code and deliverables and a second folder which will contain rough drafts and intermediate versions of code.
In addition to each folder, we will have this README.md file.
Our team will use the document 'Progress.md' to catalog Miniproject tasks as 'to be done', 'in progress', and 'done', and this file will also exist outside the
Miniproject folders.
