# SEEDLAB_TEAM8
All Code for Our Seed Lab Project (Mini-Project - Final Demo)
## Purpose
The purpose of our repository is to store all working code that controls our robot for the Miniproject, Demo 1, Demo 2, and all other assignments for SEED Lab.
## Organization
Our repository will have one folder for every assignment that contains all of the code developed for that assignment. Each assignment folder will have all final code
  and deliverables in one folder, as well as rough drafts and intermediate versions of code in another folder.
In addition to each folder, we will have this README.md file as well as a text file called 'enough git to skin a cat.txt'. This text file describes basic git operations
  and how to execute them on a command line.
Our team will use the document 'Progress.md' to catalog tasks as 'to be done', 'in progress', and 'done', and this file will also exist outside the project folders.
